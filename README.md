#Day Planner JS/JQ
***We first made a function to make the typed text console.log to local storage while using the ${} to getelementbyID instead followed by the list of each column for 9am-5pm but we had to label each one using military time since it won't count past 12 but used the currentHour function and using the parseInt with Capital H  because of the military time  ***



***We then made a function to be able follow the time columns with the current system time to link the css colors so that they change accordingly to what time is it***
